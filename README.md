DKO Category Widget
===================

Drag the widget into a sidebar, select a category.

The widget has a title that links to a page with the same name as the category
or the category page if the category is a subcategory.

The widget displays a post thumbnail, one tag, and excerpt for the first post.
For up to 2 posts after that, only the title are shown.

Obviously this was made for a specific project, but might as well make it
reusable.
